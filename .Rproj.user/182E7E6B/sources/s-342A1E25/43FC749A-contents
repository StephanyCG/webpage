abstract = "Evapotranspiration (ET) is essential to improve the understanding of the water exchange between the earth's surface and the atmosphere (hydrological cycle). Its monitoring is also crucial to design and adequate management of irrigation programs in crops, conservation of water resources and the hydraulics infrastructure planning. However, in Peru there are no detailed studies to understand the process of evapotranspiration. This is mainly due to the heterogeneity of the landscape, the lack of data measured directly in the field and the number of factors involved in its estimation. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to characterize the evapotranspiration in the crops surrounding the Huancayo Observatory (OH) of the IGP located in the Mantaro Valley, using measurements of a flux tower."

abstract_short = "Evapotranspiration has an important role for crop irrigation and water balance, however, evapotranspiration studies in Peru are scarce. Thus, in this study we use the eddy covariance technique to measure evapotranspiration in the crops surrounding the Huancayo Observatory (OH) of the IGP located in the Mantaro Valley  during the months of July 2015 and July 2016."
